# Backdrop Coding Challenge

This is my implementation for the backdrop coding challenge.

## Installation

Use the package manager [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create a config folder in the root of the application and add these files:

development.env

test.env

The file .env.example contains the necessary keys for the app to run.

## Usage

start app

```bash
npm run dev
```

run test

```bash
npm run test
```
